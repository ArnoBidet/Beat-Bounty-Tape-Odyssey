Thank you for your download!

Please note that the blank space on the tileset is there for future additions to the tileset, or if you'd like to add to it yourself. This will hopefully ensure that reimporting the updated tileset into your project won't cause any issues (existing tiles will remain in their current locations on the tileset).
